The goal of the CMMC is to build a micorbial metabolite knowledgebase with and for the scientific community according to the RFA Identification and Characterization of Bioactive Microbial Metabolites. This center is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Advancing Research on Microbe-Diet-Host Interactions Knowledgebase Management Center (U24) grant mechanism - RFA Link . Key Objectives \u00b6 We aim to capture the knowledge about microbial metabolites, even detectable but uncharacterized microbial metabolites to build a microbial metabolite knowledgebase. The goal of the knowledgebase is to ensure it can be reused to make it easier to mechanistically understand the functional role of the microbiome. This will be accomplished through digitizing the relationships between diet, host and microbial metabolism and the activities of the metabolites. Tools created by the CMMC with and for the community \u00b6 Here is a list of tools that were developed specifically for the CMMC that is in conjunction with the computational tools available at UCSD and UCR. Microbial metabolite knowledge upload portal. \u00b6 To build the microbial knowledgebase we have generated an upload portal. This will generate the foundational knowledgebase to enable future tool building. As RO1 gratees add to the knowledgebase it will be immediately usable in GNPS based molecular networking ( Link ) so that microbial metabolite knowledge can be immediately identified from complex samples. If a batch upload on microbial knowledge is needed, please contact Dorrestein and Wang at pdorrestein@health.ucsd.edu or mingxun.wang@ucr.edu. MicrobeMASST \u00b6 MicrobeMASST allows MS/MS searches against >60,000 LC-MS/MS files from cultured bacteria and fungi. Such searches allows the user to observe where the same MS/MS (or analog) belonging to a microbial metabolite of interest. This is unpublished but already usable - check out the beta version of Microbe MASST ! R01s Supported by CMMC \u00b6 This infrastructure us being build with R01's that responded to Identification and Characterization of Bioactive Microbial Metabolites for Advancing Research on Microbe-Diet-Host Interactions (R01) https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-21-253.html Here is a link to all the current R01 grantees that received awards under this mechanism - All R01 Grants Link . In addition the CMMC will be curated with the large scientific community. Leadership \u00b6 Pieter C.
