# Collaborative Microbial Metabolomics Center

![](img/logo.png)

Welcome to the Collaborative Microbial Metabolomics (CMMC) Center at the UC San Diego and UC Riverside. The goal of the CMMC is the Identification and Characterization of Bioactive Microbial Metabolites. This center is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Advancing Research on Microbe-Diet-Host Interactions Knowledgebase Management Center (U24) grant mechanism. 

## Key Objectives

We aim to build a microbial metabolite knowledgebase that can be reused to make it easier to mechanistically understand the functional role of the microbiome through digitizing the relationships between diet, host and microbial metabolism and the activities of the metabolites. 

## Tools From the CMMC

Here is a list of tools that were developed specifically for the CMMC that is in conjunction with the computational tools available at UCSD and UCR.
