If you have any questions about how to use and contribute to the Collaborative Microbial Metabolite Center, we invite
you to participate in the CMMC Office Hours online with Helena or
Shipei ([hmannochiorusso@health.ucsd.edu](mailto:hmannochiorusso@health.ucsd.edu), [s1xing@health.ucsd.edu](mailto:s1xing@health.ucsd.edu)).

In the office hours, we will cover personal questions about CMMC on how people can contribute to the knowledgebase, and
how people can use the resources available as part of the center.

We will start the office hours at the time above, and we will finish it when all the questions are solved.
